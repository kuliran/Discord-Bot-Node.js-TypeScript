Discord Bot setup + custom Event/SlashCommand handler

Learning Typescript and Node.js for the first time

The package (initHandler) allows to organize command and event modules under different folders that describe separate systems
rather than putting every module inside single "commands" and "events" folders, which can make it hard to edit specific systems (in the case of a multifunctional bot)

It also uses `.env` module to keep the sensitive info protected from getting leaked on GitHub (with .gitignore file) 

Hierarchy example (in src folder):
    systems (folder)

        levelling (folder)
            commands (folder)
                getExp (file)
            events (folder)
                messageCreate (folder)
                    giveExp (file)

        welcomeMessage (folder)
            commands (folder)
                configure-channel (file)
                remove-channel (file)
            events (folder)
                memberAdded (folder)
                    printWelcomeMessage (file)

PS: I also wanted to handle the systems provided in the example, but MongoDB just didn't want me to sign up. Hence why no database :/
